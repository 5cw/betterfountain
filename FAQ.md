# What is "Fountain"?

I'm not going to do a good job at explaining it, so just [look at this page](https://fountain.io/faq).

# So what is "Better fountain"?

"Better fountain" is an extension for a really popular text editor (visual studio code) which makes it even easier and faster to write screenplays with the fountain syntax.

# Getting started

Here are a few super simple steps to get started:

1. Download and install Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's a really nice text editor, primarily designed for programming. But it's really flexible and powerful, so it can be used for lots of other things (including screenwriting)

2. Go [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain) and click on install.

3. That's it! Now you can create a new file which finishes with the ".fountain" file extension (to do this in visual studio code, go to `File`>`New File` and then `File`>`Save as`).


# Tips

* Everything in visual studio code is done through the "command palette" which you can bring up by clicking on `View`>`Command Palette` or by pressing on the F1 key.

* Here are some useful commands:
  * "Fold all" > Folds all the scenes so that you can only see the header. "Unfold all" does the contrary.
  * "Fountain: Show Screenplay Live Preview": Show a preview of what the printed script would look like, in real-time.
  * "Fountain: Export Screenplay PDF": Export your screenplay to a pdf file.
