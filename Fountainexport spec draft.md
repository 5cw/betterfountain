### Description

While a `.fountain` document describes the content of a screenplay, a `.fountainexport` file describes how this content should be rendered into a PDF. It's a powerful way of working with fountain documents, and enables the following scenarios:

* Automating the creation of multiple PDFs with different characteristics, for various actors and/or departements
* Systematically rendering PDFs any time the document is saved, or only rendering them on demand
